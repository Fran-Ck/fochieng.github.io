The statement of Aspiration Practice &nbsp;for IR,&rdquo;The Move to an institutional research function.. Is needed to assure that informed decisions routinely occur across an organization with the speed and flexibility required for real world management of modern postsecondary education.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a major disruption in major ways forcing colleges and university leaders and academic staff to deal with major transformation in how learning is conducted, probable declines in revenue, hiring freezes, lay-offs and attempts to plan for the future. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To navigate this difficult path, universities and other institutions of higher learning need to intensify their institutional data collection and analysis. It is however unfortunate that most universities and colleges have limited formal policies and strategies for gathering institutional data and for employing trained staff to generate the information and analysis required for competent, informed and innovative management. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is about &nbsp;time that &nbsp;these institutions think in the line of generating,organizing and using their own data for strategic purposes,the office of IR capability of a university is a key component to this end. A myriad of data is collected in Colleges and Universities ranging from data about student admissions, student learning, faculty performance, operations, infrastructure and finance, however most of this uncollected data &nbsp;is underused. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Universities need to refocus their IR capacity towards institutional self improvement and quality controls, including internal accountability efforts like the review of academic departments , the evaluation of campus initiatives, enrollment planning and tackling the consequences of external forces, like Covid-19. However, to do this, academic leaders and their faculties need to have a greater understanding of the value of IR as an essential tool for managing their universities.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">IR capability generally focuses on the concept of data-driven decision making by &nbsp;linking &nbsp;institutional data and management with efforts around strategic planning.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5">Developing Capacity for IR</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A recent study by the public universities in the U.S. concluded that offices of institutional research are &ldquo;deluged by demands for data collection and report writing that blot out time and attention for deeper research, analysis and communication&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It is easy to Imagine professional development specialists who works on building skills in collecting, cleaning, storing, summarizing and communicating data specific to the work of units and departments. Effective IR capacity also requires a conceptual model in which universities collect and use university wide data, the decentralized nature of many universities has posed challenges for systematically collecting useful information, wth departments, schools and faculties sometimes claiming exclusive control of what data is collected and made available to the academic leaders.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To build their IR capacity, &nbsp;institutions need to structure their data collection and analysis efforts around the teaching and learning, research and public service activities and their academic community and constituents. This includes efforts to better understand and improve student experience and promote student learning outcomes and degree completion.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The future role for institutional research is oversight of data and analytical tools as valuable resources that empower decision making at the tactical and operational levels. &nbsp;These decision makers should also include faculty, students and administrative staff as clients and co-participants in IR data gathering and analysis.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To quote a famous statement often used among Institutional researchers,&rdquo;Data don&rsquo;t speak for themselves, and they never talk to strangers&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It would be my hope that this article inspires a conversation about data and the student centered paradigm.</span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Author: Francis Ochieng Omondi</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Kca University</span></p></body></html>
